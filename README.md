ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @segbourne - I'm pivoting to a new skill and potentially a career change later down the line.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding! I've just started out with Python and my goal is to be able to follow along a tutorial to make a basic farming simulator to demo what I've learned. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python - turning to dabble with SQL data analysis
